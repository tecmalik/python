pseudocode 
initialize firstNumber to random number
initialize secondNumber to second random
initialize passcount = 0
initialize failcount = 0
initialize answer = 0
for count in range (1,11):
if firstNumber greater then SecondNumber
 prompt user to answer Subtract {firstnumber} from {secondNumber} what will the answer be ?
if answer equal to firstNumber-secondNumber:
passcount +=1
else 
failcount+=1
else :
answer = input(f"Subtract {secondNumber} from  {firstnumber}what will teh anser be ?" )
if answer == secondNumber-firstNumber:
passcount +=1
else failcount+=1
display you Score passcount of 10 and failed failcount
